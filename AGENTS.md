## Project Overview

mddb is a Notion-like document and database system. Frontend built with SolidJS, backend with Go. Data stored
as markdown files and images.

### Documentation Changes

- **Do NOT** create a markdown file listing changes you made.
- Update `docs/PLAN.md` to reflect status changes.
- Keep `README.md` up to date.
- **Always update the purpose comment** at the beginning of a source file when the code's purpose changes. This comment is used to generate the file index in `AGENTS.md`.

### Professionalism

After making changes, run:

```bash
make lint build test
```
