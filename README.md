## What is mddb?

mddb lets you:
- 📝 **Create and edit documents**: Write in markdown with live preview (Google Docs)
- 📊 **Build tables**: Store structured data with typed columns and cross table references (Google Sheets)
- 🗂️ **Organize information**: Create folders and nested structures (Google Drive)
- ⚡ **Auto-save**: Changes save automatically as you work
- 📁 **Keep it local**: All data stored as files on your computer
- 🔄 **Git-native**: Every change is a git commit—sync to any remote, track history, branch and merge
- 🔍 **Search**: Search across documents, tables, and folders
- 🚀 **Designed for LLM agents**: storage is easy for an agent to navigate

> **Note**: mddb uses a two-level hierarchy:
> - **Organization**: Billing and administrative entity (like a company or team)
> - **Workspace**: Isolated content container within an organization (like a project or department)
> - **Table** instead of Notion's "Database" (a collection of records with columns)
>
> Each workspace has its own pages, tables, and git remote for syncing.

## Getting Started

See [SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md) to run it yourself for free and access it securely from Tailscale.

## File Structure

All data is stored as plain files. Each workspace is a separate git repository:

```
data/
├── db/                             # Identity database (users, orgs, memberships)
└── <workspace-id>/                 # Each workspace is independent
    ├── AGENTS.md                   # Workspace documentation for AI agents
    └── <node-id>/                  # Node (document, table, or hybrid)
        ├── index.md                # Document content with YAML front matter
        ├── data.jsonl              # Table records (one JSON per line)
        ├── data.blobs/             # Binary assets (images, files)
        └── <asset-files>           # Asset files stored alongside
```

Every content mutation is a git commit. You can:
- Edit files directly with any text editor
- Sync each workspace to GitHub, GitLab, or any git remote
- Use git history, branches, and merge workflows
- Back up with standard tools

Organization membership is stored in the identity database, not in the file structure.

## FAQ

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes! Everything runs locally. No data is sent anywhere.

**Q: Can I sync across devices?**
A: Configure a git remote in workspace settings—changes push automatically.

**Q: Can I import/export my data?**
A: The data is itself in text form.
